# Random Joke Generator
A simple, barebones website that generates a random joke on request.

Interfaces with the [Official Joke API](https://github.com/15Dkatz/official_joke_api?tab=readme-ov-file).

Can generate four types of jokes: general jokes, knock-knock jokes, programming jokes, and dad jokes. (NOTE: there are not many knock-knock and dad jokes available).
